## 🚀 About Me

I'm a dedicated blockchain researcher and development student with a strong foundation in decentralized systems. My journey began with an A.S. in Web Design and experience in phone operations in the U.S. Army. Since then, I’ve transitioned from traditional roles in security and manufacturing to the forefront of Web3 innovation.

In 2021, my partner and I founded **New World Cryptos**, an education and consulting platform focused on blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and precious metals. As of September 3, 2024, it’s an official trademark with the USPTO. While the platform is currently paused, I'm deepening my technical skills to bring more value to future clients and the broader blockchain ecosystem.
