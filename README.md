## 🧠 About Me

I'm a blockchain developer, educator, consultant, and researcher focused on advancing decentralized technologies, smart contract development, and financial sovereignty.
As Co-Founder and Co-CEO of New World Cryptos — founded in 2022 and a registered USPTO trademark as of 2024 — I lead a dual-platform initiative dedicated to blockchain education, decentralized infrastructure, and sovereign empowerment.
Our original site, NewWorldCryptos.com, is a community education and consulting hub (currently paused while I complete advanced blockchain studies).
Our latest addition, New World Cryptos Journal, is a self-hosted Ghost publication for blockchain research, dev logs, and crypto intelligence built for the Web3 era.
I work hands-on with Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, and related tools to develop and test smart contracts, while also publishing insights that blend code, research, and macro-level analysis.
