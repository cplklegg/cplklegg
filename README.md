## 🧠 About Me
I'm a dedicated blockchain educator, consultant, and aspiring developer with a robust foundation in computer science, Linux systems, and decentralized technologies. My journey began with an A.S. in Web Design and experience in phone operations in the U.S. Army. Since then, I've transitioned from traditional roles in security and manufacturing to the forefront of Web3 innovation.

In 2021, my partner and I founded New World Cryptos, a trademarked Private Membership Association (PMA) focused on blockchain education, cryptocurrency consulting, and precious metals. Our mission is to empower individuals with knowledge and tools to navigate the decentralized world confidently.

📈 Crypto Market Analysis
I approach each project by analyzing its use cases, fundamentals, and connections with both legacy and emerging crypto businesses. For instance, I view ONDO as a strong medium to long-term play in the RWA sector due to its solid fundamentals and backing by BlackRock. Conversely, while OM (Mantra) showed promising data analytics, recent events have highlighted its high-risk nature. I prioritize data-driven insights and real-world connections over hype.
