## 🧠 About Me

I’m a blockchain educator, researcher, and developer focused on advancing decentralized technologies and financial freedom.

As Co-Founder of **New World Cryptos**, I lead blockchain education initiatives, create community resources, and advocate for responsible crypto adoption. I publish **The WeeklyWEB3Walkthru**, a newsletter tracking Bitcoin metrics, altcoin trends, regulatory developments, and emerging blockchain ecosystems.

Currently, I am expanding my research platform through **Patreon**, where I will release in-depth blockchain research reports, token analysis, and educational guides. I actively develop my technical skills through GitHub projects, practicing **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **Foundry**, and blockchain application development.

My research philosophy centers on fundamentals — real-world use cases, tokenomics, institutional partnerships, and macroeconomic factors — rather than hype or price speculation. I believe in delivering actionable insights backed by data, on-chain metrics, and Web3-native sources.
